It\\u2019s hard to tell if it's already happening since digital payments is growing rapidly, up 114% internationally and 50% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The majority of the transactions are coming from new customers who are using their mobile phones. It\\u2019s not overlapping with the walk-in customers.

(South China Morning Post, February 24, 2020.)Singapore: real estate companies freeze wages CapitaLand became the latest company in Singapore to implement a pay freeze due to Covid-19, saying board members and senior management will take a reduction in their fees and base salaries ranging from 5% to 15%.

My work as a performance psychologist for hedge funds and trading firms has never been busier. The uncertainty and potential economic and market risks associated with a coronavirus outbreak have investors running for the relative safety of investment grade fixed income and away from the very growth stocks that were recent market darlings. How can psychology help us at such periods of risk and uncertainty? Below are a few themes that have stood out in my conversations with professional money managers:1) A Knowledge Of Market History Can Be Valuable - History is far from a perfect predictor of the future, but it beats ignorance. In the last Forbes article, I highlighted a number of research services that track the markets daily and examine historical performance under similar circumstances. A common theme among these reports is that the stock market tends to rebound after extreme weakness, but that the path forward tends to be volatile, with plenty of shorter-term moves up and down. This can offer promise (and overexcitement) to nimble traders seeking movement and challenge (and risk aversion) to investors seeking stability. For example, I note from the Index Indicators site that, as of the close on Friday, February 28th, fewer than 5% of all stocks in the Standard and Poor\\u2019s 500 Index closed above their 5, 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages. That is evidence of very broad market weakness. Since 2006, when I started my database, there have been only nine daily occasions with such readings. Five of these occurred in October and November of 2008; two clustered in August of 2011. Returns were highly volatile going forward, reflecting a market VIX that averaged over 50 across the occasions. Six of the nine occasions saw daily closes over 6% higher in the following week. The 2008 and 2011 occasions ultimately saw us make lower lows in coming months. A simple mindset of doom and gloom or optimistic \\u201cbuy the dip\\u201d is not supported by history. The real takeaway is that volatility is more sticky than directional movement\\u2014and we need to be prepared for that.2) A Knowledge Of Market History Can Be Dangerous - Whenever your sample size is nine, with overlapping occasions, you have a small group of examples to draw conclusions from. It\\u2019s also not one that leads itself to robust statistical analysis. It is easy to see in history what we want to see. The smart investor or trader uses history to frame hypotheses, not to feed confirmation bias and become locked into conclusions. In the current market situation, an overreliance on market history may be especially misleading. The circumstances leading to the recent market weakness\\u2014a potential global pandemic\\u2014are not circumstances that have occurred during similar market declines. This is why the savvy investors I speak with are closely tracking case reports in Asia and Europe, consulting with experts in epidemiology, and paying attention to economic statistics around the globe. Finance professor Campbell Harvey makes the case that one of the systemic risks of the virus is economic recession. Indeed, further spread of the virus could set up a situation in which workers can\\u2019t afford to stay home, exacerbating health and economic impacts. A history of past epidemics may be more enlightening than recent market history and suggests that such problems can take a while to play out.3) How We Manage Ourselves Shapes How We Manage Risk - We know that stressful conditions introduce a fight or flight reaction of mind and body that can lead us to make short-sighted, reactive decisions. The smartest money managers I work with are taking extra steps to maximize their energy and mindset, realizing that volatile market conditions can introduce unusual risk and opportunity. A common theme in our discussions is doubling down on slowing ourselves down when markets are speeding up. It\\u2019s the extra efforts at mindfulness that combat cognitive biases. We have declined around 10% in major stock market indexes in the U.S.; it\\u2019s not unusual to see greater declines than that during periods of recession. Many of these recessionary periods, however, have offered unusual investment and trading opportunity, punishing sound assets along with the shaky ones. In a world of continued falling interest rates, it\\u2019s hard to believe that companies with strong balance sheets and attractive yield won\\u2019t find interest among asset managers. When markets dropped meaningfully in 1973, 1987, 2000, and 2008, it took a while for bottoms to form. Ultimately, however, these declines led to unusual opportunity. Bottom line? It\\u2019s impossible to win the game if we don\\u2019t stay in the game.

But that explanation leaves me with many unanswered questions.Why did stocks keep climbing after news of the Coronavirus in China broke last December?I am sure that the selloff was not triggered by the world becoming aware of the Coronavirus \\u2014 COVID-19. If that was the cause, the crash would have happened on December 31, 2019 when cases were first reported by Chinese authorities, according to the Washington Post.While it has been reported that the selloff was triggered by reports that COVID-19 cases were appearing outside China, according to the Wall Street Journal, I did not find that explanation very satisfying.All the hedge funds dedicated to beating the market could surely have anticipated that the virus would not be contained to China. As I wrote February 3, in January Goldman Sachs predicted the Coronavirus\\u2019s economic impact. Given the rapidly-changing nature of the threat, smart investors would have recognized that there was considerable uncertainty in that forecast.PROMOTEDIndeed, MIT expert Richard Larson told me that over-reaction to Coronavirus could cause the biggest economic impact. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 kept rising most of the month to peak at 3,386 on February 19. Since then, stocks have lost $4.6 trillion in value, according to Barron\\u2019s.How serious is the potential economic impact of COVID-19?Since not much is known about COVID-19, it makes sense to forecast different scenarios. According to the February 29th Economist, the worst case scenario \\u2014 similar to the 1918-19 drop in GDP resulting from the Spanish Flu \\u2014 is about what happened in the 2009 financial crisis \\u2014 a 5% drop in GDP.This is based on a 2006 economic model of an influenza pandemic created by Warwick McKibbin and Alexandra Sidorenko, both then at Australian National University. The Economist reported that their \\u201cmild\\u201d scenario is for a mere 0.8% drop in global GDP \\u2014 assuming that 30% of people are infected, losing on average ten days\\u2019 work each, and a fatality rate of 0.25%. The mild scenario would trim a quarter of the global growth previously forecast for 2020.McKibbin thinks that the model\\u2019s \\u201cmoderate\\u201d scenario \\u2014 a 2% hit to global growth \\u2014 best fits COVID-19. That is worse than the forecast from Oxford Economics \\u2014 which expects COVID-19 to cut 1.3% from global GDP.Anecdotal evidence \\u2014 e.g., companies like Microsoft reporting that COVID-19 would make it impossible to meet first quarter revenue guidance, according to CNBC \\u2014 suggests reasons for concern in some stocks.However, I think a smart investor would realize that a temporary slowdown in production due to supply chain interruptions would be made up in future quarters once COVID-19 is under control.Moreover, if these economic forecasts are accurate and the world\\u2019s economic growth takes a 1.3% to 2% hit as a result of COVID-19, this week\\u2019s market correction seems vastly overblown.How did computer-driven trading contribute to the stock plunge?To understand why the markets overshot, it helps to look at Wall Street\\u2019s so-called fear gauge \\u2014 the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX).When word of China\\u2019s coronavirus was first reported on December 31, the VIX was at 13.78, according to the Cboe. On February 19 \\u2014 when the S&P 500 peaked \\u2014 it had risen slightly to 14.38.From there, markets plunged and the VIX spiked. By February 28, it had more than tripled to 49.15, its highest intraday level since February 2018, according to CNBC.Computer-driven trading linked to a spike in the VIX is probably responsible for the waves of selling that wiped 12% from stocks during the week. Unfortunately, I could not find out how much of this week\\u2019s trading volume was due to these hedging trades.The Journal reported that a large amount of trading \\u2014 more than $100 billion in selling February 24 and 25 \\u2014 \\u201cwas fueled by options hedging and trading strategies based on market volatility\\u201d according to Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase, who said that investors\\u2019 ability to get in and out of positions also worsened this week.Options trading strategies put in place by hedge funds and other institutional investors have triggered computers to sell more stock as prices fell. As the Journal reported, one such strategy \\u2014 so-called short gamma positioning \\u2014 pushed prices down abruptly during the week.Traders sold more stock as prices dropped due to Gamma \\u2014 which \\u201cmeasures how much the price of an option accelerates when the price of the underlying security shifts,\\u201d noted the Journal. Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura, wrote that \\u201cDealers are in the \\u2018short Gamma\\u2019 zone, and that added to the move to the downside [Monday], as they generically speaking were sellers the lower we traveled.\\u201dFor every percentage point that the S&P 500 dropped, SqueezeMetrics estimated that tens of billions of dollars of S&P 500 futures had to be sold.Here\\u2019s how the trade works. Investors buy S&P 500 put options \\u2014 which give them the right, but not the obligation to sell the S&P 500 at a specific price at a future date \\u2014 from options dealers, who take the other side of the trade. The put options rise in value for the investor as the S&P 500 plunges while losing money for the seller.Why is there pressure to sell stock as that put option is rising in value? As the Journal wrote, \\u201cProfessional options dealers try to maintain neutral positions in the market and remain constantly hedged. As markets fall, options dealers sell stocks or stock futures to offset those positions. The selling can intensify the more stocks fall.\\u201dThe profits in this trade attracted other investors who decided to bet on the increase in the VIX \\u2014 using an an exchange-traded product tied to VIX derivatives. This week VIX-related options volumes \\u201chit the highest level since May,\\u201d according to the Journal.The market physics of this options-linked trading could also send stocks soaring. The same selling- begets-selling dynamic that slashes stock prices can send them soaring if prices rise.

(Language may not be safe for work. Of course.)PROMOTEDA recently published study by professor Aaron Kay, out of Duke University, addresses this. From the abstract:The pursuit of passion in one's work is touted in contemporary discourse. Although passion may indeed be beneficial in many ways, we suggest that the modern cultural emphasis may also serve to facilitate the legitimization of unfair and demeaning management practices-a phenomenon we term the legitimization of passion exploitation.A collection of studies shows that people think \\\"poor worker treatment\\\" (like expecting extra hours of work for no additional money) is seen as \\\"more legitimate when workers are presumed to be 'passionate' about their work.\\\" That appears in assumptions that someone would have done the work anyway or that the work is its own reward for the people.When people are exploited, another aspect of the attitude leads in reverse to assumptions that the workers must be more passionate about what they're doing rather than simply being exploited. Interestingly, the more people believe in a \\\"just world,\\\" the more likely they're willing to excuse away the treatment.Perhaps these mechanisms are what make so many assume they can reasonably ask designers, writers, graphic artists, and so many others to work for free. Or maybe it is nothing more than the wish to steal someone else\\u2019s time and effort.The exposure line is that you may not get paid, but doing work appearing in public can be a terrific form of advertising and eventually help draw an audience and paying work. In some ways, that may be true. Musicians play on the street or put their work up to be heard online. Artists promote themselves on websites.The difference is they are the only ones benefiting from the marketing activities (other than perhaps a service they use to transmit the work, because everyone needs to get paid). They're not donating work to primarily promote another, with the chance of a benefit for themselves only possibly appearing in passing.The attitudes that enable such exploitation\\u2014and exploitation it is when you expect people to do things for you with nothing in return\\u2014aren't a form of capitalism. Then there would be an expectation that of course someone needs to be paid in some form to do work to advance your interests.Instead, this the psychological framing of con artists who either hope the sales pitch will work or want to feel comfortable when confronting a mirror later in the day. The connection between the willingness to exploit and a stated believe in social justice puts the ironic icing atop the cake.The desire for freebies are also broader and get to the issue of minimum wage. If people in society were truly reasonable and honest, they'd expect that others should at least be able to live on what they make. Maybe not lavishly (there's much to be said for ambition and effort to advance one's self), but at least in a human fashion. A roof over the head, food on the table, transportation to where people have to go, a way to look after children while making a living, and some opportunity to learn, expand, and move to the next stage of life.You can see many who want to excuse abysmally low wage levels as a kind of proving ground everyone should go though, preferably on afternoons when high school is over. But the money was too little years ago. Inflation has turned low wages into a nightmare.Arguing that someone deserves their lot because they didn't work harder or do better in school is smug nonsense. People need opportunity and resources to do better (many of the loudest voices dismissing low-wage workers forget what aid they received over the years) and many of the working poor expend more effort and diligence than most people in middle- to upper-class environments would know how to muster.This is American Socialism: transfers of wealth, income, and life upward from those below. The beneficiaries aren't just the one-percenters. They are everyone who gets to keep a little more in their pocket because so many on whom they directly and indirectly depend get less in theirs.\", \"tickers\": [], \"url\": \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2020/02/29/another-form-of-income-inequality-people-maybe-including-you-excuse-away/\", \"headline\": \"Another Form Of Income Inequality People (Maybe Including You) Excuse Away\", \"paragraphs\": [\"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"The Irish Times ran a piece a couple of weeks ago, around the time of national elections, about artists who are riled over a specific social condition that struck home: being asked to work for free:\\\", \\\"tickers\\\": []}\", \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Emmet Kirwan, the actor, playwright and screenwriter (of Dublin Oldschool), also spoke at the Paying the Artists launch. \\\\\\\"Art cannot survive in a free-market neoliberal economy.

To these investors, the fear of coronavirus is real and will have severe implications for the global economy. However, in their view, the market sell-off is more than this singular incident.

That it has not been the case owes much to another form of sickness \\u2013 over exuberance in financial marketplace. The catalysts provided by the coronavirus are now treating this (in the short run the sell-off is nearly complete, and we will rally mid next week).Ironically, in an age of machines, and where social media companies are dominant in many senses, markets are responding to the risk that humans will have less physical interaction with each other and will enjoy less physical forms of consumption (travel, shopping and consumption).As I write, it appears at least from official numbers that the virus is somewhat contained in China, and globally the number of cases looks to have peaked. Here though, the risk is that the Chinese authorities rush people back to work and, like the Spanish flu in 1918, there is a bigger second (and third) wave of the virus.PROMOTEDThe passage of the virus across the world has, even at what might be an early stage, revealed and further provoked a number of changes in our world.The first relates to trust. There is widespread suspicion inside and beyond China that the authorities there have not been upfront about the true extent of the virus. Some, like US Senator Tom Cotton even believe that the virus is man-made. To that end, while China\\u2019s handling of the crisis will on one hand reinforce the sense that it can marshal huge swathes of its population, on the other the trust of outsiders in the Chinese authorities will diminish. The Belt and Road Initiative may be a casualty here. Distrust can also channel itself in other ways. If in the future China has a debt crisis, investors are likely to sell first than wait for a true picture to emerge.Within China this episode has clearly damaged the Communist Party, though it is very hard to see how this will play out in public life, or even through social media discourse. My sense is that the Chinese authorities will react in at least two ways. One is a fiscal stimulus made up of tax breaks, support for small businesses and an acceleration of infrastructure programs.The other more interesting one is to take what has been done in the domain of social control and social credit scoring and apply this to healthcare. I can envisage a sharp rise in self-diagnosis, tech based medicine and a related set of incentives for people to allow their health data be monitored by the state. If it happens, many in the West would consider it insidious, though given the fear created by the virus, many Chinese might acquiesce.The second effect of the coronavirus crisis is that it is yet another event that makes visible the arteries of globalization and leaves them atrophied. That there has been little to no coordination between nations speaks to a sense of a fractured world, and the performance of the WHO reinforces the view that like the WTO, its time has come.There will be a sharp short-term hit to world trade from the coronavirus (hotels, airlines are the obvious \\u2018victim\\u2019 industries though I think that \\u2018elite\\u2019 forms of travel and healthcare will continue to thrive), but in the longer-term it will also reinforce the sense in governments and some companies that security of production is increasingly important.To that end, the rise of national champions and the relocation of production to \\u2018home\\u2019 countries (pharmaceuticals is an example) will continue. In many different ways, the coronavirus, like the 2019 trade war, will force a rethinking of globalization by corporates.Other megatrends may also be rethought. India and many parts of Africa are the only parts of the world where urbanization rates are still relatively low, though where the rate of urbanization is now picking up. The coronavirus crisis is a very clear reminder of \\u2018smart\\u2019 urbanization is terms of the health, data gathering and communication implications, and in this way the lessons for Wuhan are yet to be learnt. For example, it is only emerging that 40% of the coronavirus cases in Wuhan were transmitted in hospitals \\u2013 and the same may be true of both Italy and Iran. As this adjustment process happens, there will likely be one constant, which is the vogue of central banks to meet any threat to growth and attendant dip in markets with more liquidity. Liquidity provision and rate cuts will not solve the process of adjustment away from globalization, and in the long run they may channel this process down the wrong path because cheap money increases the risk that investment decisions are badly made. \", \"tickers\": [], \"url\": \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2020/02/29/globalization-crashesspread-of-coronavirus-signals-end-of-interconnected-world/\", \"headline\": \"Globalization Crashes - Spread Of Coronavirus Signals End Of Interconnected World\", \"paragraphs\": [\"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tickers\\\": []}\", \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"That a rugby match in Dublin between Italy and Ireland can be cancelled because of a virus that germinated in a market in a Chinese city, may be a chain of events that appeals to amateur chaos theorists.\\\", \\\"tickers\\\": []}\", \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"In my view, the panic caused by the coronavirus illustrates how easily interconnected the world has become, how fluidly people move from one location to another, and how national infrastructure and policy systems are still so very different.\\\", \\\"tickers\\\": []}\", \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"With the spread of the virus across China manifest some weeks ago,  thought that markets at least would quickly work through the implications.
